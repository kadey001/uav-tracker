# UAV Tracker Simulator
A webapp that is designed to simulate the movement of UAVs on a world map.

## Planned Features
1. Path Tracking (showing path that UAV was taking as well as where it is going if path is pre-planned)
2. Ability to edit attributes of any UAV you click on
3. Ability to select a single UAV and "follow" it (ie. keep the camera on it as it moves)
4. Simulated combat?
5. Status indicators (maybe color of UAV indicates its status. EG: Red=Damaged,Green=Good,Yellow=Warnings,etc...)
6. Optimizations to allow for thousands of UAVs to be tracked at once without performance issues.

## Running the project
1. Install dependencies:
   `npm install`
2. Run the app:
   `npm run dev`
